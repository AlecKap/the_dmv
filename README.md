# The DMV

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.

1. Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? 
   If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.
      - I should have used the pry more to really find out what was going on in my code. I also took the time to review the enumerables which helped. 

2. What was hard about working with code you did not write?
      - It was really hard to understand and try and guess what mistakes this programer would normally make. 
        I know what mistakes i commonly make so it makes it easier to problem solve more quickly.

3. What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? 
   What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?
      - Like i said above, i should be using my pry a lot more than i did. Debuggin someones code is hard.
